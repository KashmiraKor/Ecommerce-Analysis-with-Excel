# Ecommerce-Analysis-with-Excel

## Project Overview

This project, titled "Streamline & Spotlight," focuses on the intersection of supply chain operations and digital consumer behavior. It involves a detailed analysis of two datasets: the supply chain metrics dataset (`DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv`) and the digital access logs dataset (`TokenizedAccessLogs.csv`). The primary goal is to uncover strategies for operational excellence and enhanced digital outreach through comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Excel.

## Objectives

- Conduct an in-depth analysis of supply chain and digital access datasets.
- Identify key patterns and trends to improve supply chain efficiency and digital marketing strategies.
- Develop a comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard to visualize supply chain metrics and customer engagement.
